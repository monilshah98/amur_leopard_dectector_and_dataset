# amur_leopard_dataset
This is the dataset of one of the most critically endangered species Amur Leopard, that i collected to train my own amur-leopard detector using [TensorFlow's Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection). The total dataset consists of 200 images that i collected from google and labelled it using [Label Img](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg). I used 160 images for training and 40 images for validation.
